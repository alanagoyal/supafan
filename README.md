## About

This is an app that allows users & fans to post messages about why they love Supabase. Built with ❤️ for Supabase's off-site.

## Getting Started

Run `npm install`

Go to [Supabase](https://supabase.com), sign up or log in, and [create a new project](https://app.supabase.com/).

After your project is ready, create a table in your Supabase database using the [SQL Editor](https://app.supabase.com/project/_/sql) in the Dashboard. Use the following SQL statement to create a ratings table with some sample data.

```sql
create table messages (
  id bigint generated by default as identity primary key,
  inserted_at timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now()) not null,
  date timestamp with time zone,
  message_text text,
  gif_url text);
```

Create a new file in the root directory called `.env` and add your [project URL and public API key](https://app.supabase.com/project/_/settings/api):

```javascript
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL = "https://<project>.supabase.co";
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY = "<your-anon-key>";
```

You'll also need API keys for [Pyq](https://www.pyqai.com/) (content filtering), [Tenor](https://tenor.com/) (gif generation), and [Resend](https://resend.com/) (emails).

Run `npm run dev`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
